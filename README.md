# self-driving-car

This project is an implementation of the research paper ”End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars” published by NVIDIA in 2016. The goal is to demonstrate how a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with image processing techniques can be used to achieve real-time road boundary detection and lane tracking. The trained model enables a self-driving car to follow the road autonomously and is tested in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.
